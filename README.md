### ShakyoRun
Enter in shakyo mode, which helps you memorise the text on the current buffer.  
In the mode a new buffer is created. You can edit text there. Characters you write wrongly are highlighted. If you write up a full line correctly, the end of the line is highlighted.

### ShakyoQuit
You can always quit shakyo mode.

### ShakyoClue
You can always get clues. This displays the first letter of characters in the current line which are different from the example text.
